        I ended up doing the project alone, so it's a bit lackluster. I know 
        this is not optimal, and I give a better effort of finding a group next
        time. I hope it does not take too much away from the project.<br>
        I did not make the test data generation, so it's only few data available
        in tests.<br>
        I decided to make the database using mysql workbench, and make the entity
        classes from the database. It seemed like the simpler way to do it, and 
        easier to control how the database was structured. <br>
        In hindsight, it might have been easier to do it the other way, since the 
        database was only used via the entity classes. It was not always clear for 
        for me how the entity classes was tied together.<br>
