        <h3>Backend test</h3>
        Testing of the Facade class using JUnit. I wanted to test each method, so given some
        correct argument, they would do and return the expected result.<br>
        I did not want to test explicit for errors, since the Facade class is 
        never given argument by an user, only be the system, so it should never 
        receive wrong arguments.<br>
        Initially all tests was correct, but during the test of the REST API, 
        I found a problem with the EditPerson method. It only returned the 
        edited Person class, but the edited InfoGeneral class is not returned.
        It is updated though, as seen by using a get on the new person will give
        a correct InfoGeneral class. I have not been able to locate the problem
        for this error.
        
        <h3>REST API test</h3>
        Testing of the REST API using RestAssured. I have tested the matching 
        get/add/edit/delete methods allowed. I also tested for some errors
        I deemed very plausible that an user would run into (person not found, 
        malformed json, wrong id input). <br>
        They are all correct, except for the 
        return of edit, but that is a problem in the Facade class as explained 
        above.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Test classes</b><br>
        For both test classes do: <br>
        Clean and build project. Run project. Run the test class 
        (FacadeTest.java, RestTest.java)<br>
        They will both give error in the EditTest, the rest of the test should
        be correct.<br>
        
        <h3>Manual testing</h3>
        Credentials for testing: password: "admin", username: "admin"<br>
        <u>GET</u><br>
        no credentials needed here<br>
        Goto <a href='/CA2/api/person/complete'>/CA2/api/person/complete</a>
        , a list of persons as json should appear.<br>
        Goto <a href='/CA2/api/person/custom/id,firstname,city'>/CA2/api/person/custom/id,firstname,city</a>
        , a list of persons as json should appear. The list should only contain ids, first names and cities. 
        Optionally try changing the last part of the url (the infolist) to other fields (as descriped in the api
        documentation <br>
        Goto <a href='/CA2/api/person/complete/1'>CA2/api/person/complete/1</a>
        , the person with id 1 and all his information as json should be appear.<br>
        You can also do custom with 1 person by id 
        <a href='/CA2/api/person/custom/1/id,firstname,city'>/CA2/api/person/custom/1/id,firstname,city</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>PUT</u><br>
        Credentials needed. Using Postman/Advanced Rest Client.<br>
        URL should be "{base}/CA2/api/person/".<br>
        Enter credentials in header. <br>
        Enter json in the body (example: {"lastname":"Mossen", "street":"HCAVej","streetnumber":"2"}). 
        The new person with id and the given info should be returned as json.<br>
        Try with unknown field in the json body (example: {"unknown":"field", "lastname":"Mossen", "street":"HCAVej","streetnumber":"2"}). 
        It should return the same as before, with a new id.<br>
        Try with an error in the json body (example: {"lastname":"Mossen", "street":"HCAVej","streetnumber"2"}). 
        It should return an error as json.<br>
        <br>
        <u>POST</u><br>
        Credentials needed. Using Postman/Advanced Rest Client.<br>
        URL should be "{base}/CA2/api/person/1". or any other id you want instead of 1<br>
        Enter credentials in header. <br>
        You can do the same tests as with PUT, except it should return all the information
        of the edited person, instead of just what given in the json body.<br>
        Try with URL "{base}/CA2/api/person/999". An error (Person not found)
        as json should be returned.<br>
        <br>
        <u>DELETE</u><br>
        Credentials needed. Using Postman/Advanced Rest Client.<br>
        URL should be "{base}/CA2/api/person/1". or any other id you want instead of 1<br>
        Enter credentials in header. <br>
        The person with id 1 and all information should appear as json. <br>
        Try with URL "{base}/CA2/api/person/999". An error (Person not found)
        as json should be returned.<br>
